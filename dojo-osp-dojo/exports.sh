# Dojo follows whichever chain your Bitcoin Node is set to -- it has no network
# of its own to choose, and pointing it at a chain its bitcoind is not on would
# only index nonsense.
#
# Two names come out of this, because Dojo collapses more than we can afford to.
# Dojo itself knows exactly two networks: keys.index.js reduces COMMON_BTC_NETWORK
# to "testnet" or "bitcoin", and lib/bitcoin/network.js then picks bitcoinjs-lib's
# testnet or mainnet parameters. testnet3, testnet4 and signet all share testnet's
# address encoding, so all three work under Dojo's "testnet" -- but they are
# different chains, and their indexed data must never be mixed. So:
#
#   APP_DOJO_BTC_NETWORK  what Dojo, nginx and the Connect page see: mainnet|testnet
#   APP_DOJO_CHAIN        the real chain, which keys the on-disk data
#
# regtest is the one we genuinely cannot serve: it uses bcrt1 addresses, and
# bitcoinjs-lib's testnet parameters would derive the wrong ones.
